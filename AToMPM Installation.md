There are three ways to install AToMPM (that I have tried and tested).

## Portable with Python2 (Windows)

*   Download the zip file from this link:
    *   [https://github.com/AToMPM/atompm/releases/download/v0.8.1/atompm-portable-python2.zip](https://github.com/AToMPM/atompm/releases/download/v0.8.1/atompm-portable-python2.zip)
*   Unzip it somewhere
*   Run AToMPM.bat file.
*   Keep in mind Python2 is not officially supported any more!

## Portable with Python3 (Windows)

*   Download the zip file from this link:
    *   [https://github.com/AToMPM/atompm/releases/download/v0.8.1/atompm-portable-python3.zip](https://github.com/AToMPM/atompm/releases/download/v0.8.1/atompm-portable-python3.zip)
*   Unzip it somewhere
*   Run AToMPM.bat file.

## Using Vagrant (Any OS)

*   Clone this repository:
    *   [https://github.com/hergin/atompm-vagrant](https://github.com/hergin/atompm-vagrant)
*   Follow the directives in the readme file
    *   [https://github.com/hergin/atompm-vagrant/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/hergin/atompm-vagrant/blob/master/README.md)

## After running it:

*   (If not automatically opens)
    *   Browse to [http://localhost:8124/atompm](http://localhost:8124/atompm) and do the transformation check: [Week 13 - AToMPM Transformation Check](https://bsu.instructure.com/courses/85755/pages/week-13-atompm-transformation-check "Week 13 - AToMPM Transformation Check")

## Official Instructions

There is also official installation instructions in the main repository of AToMPM. Check it [here](https://github.com/AToMPM/atompm) if none of the methods above work for you.
